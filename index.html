						<h3><b>About me</b></h3>
					</div>I am a recent graduate of North Carolina State University where I studied statistics and computer programming. These two disciplines combine perfectly for the career path in which I want to follow. Various school and personal projects have helped me refine the skills outlined below. I am still eager to learn new skills and even more about the ones I already possess. I have aspirations of going into data science but I have a passion for all things data and analytics. Coding has also been a long time hobby of mine. Even though I want to go into data science, data analyst, database management, and developer positions are also valuable. There, I am able to learn new things that can aid in my long term goals.</p>

								<li><button class="large red button" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" title="ST 430 - Introduction to Regression Analysis" data-content="Learned the ins and outs of linear regression. Methodically created models based on various variable selection techniques then analyzed said models in terms of accuracy. I also learned to detect various issues within the models such as over-fitting and multicollinearity by the use of graphs and intuition. The basic concepts of logistic regression were also taught. Both SAS and R were used to create and analyze these models.">Linear Regression</button></li>
								<li><button class="large red button" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover  focus" data-placement="top" title="ST 412 - Long-Term Actuarial Models" data-content="Learned the basics of risk management with a focus in the insurance sector. The various technical actuarial terms were taught along with the specific formulas and notations. The different types of life insurance policies were presented as well as how to calculate the assumed profit from each. Life contingency tables were used to aid these calculations. While this class didn't teach the first actuarial exam in full, the professor gave advice on how to proceed with studying and taking it.">Actuarial Models</button></li>
								<li><button class="large red button" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover  focus" data-placement="top" title="ST 432 - Introduction to Survey Sampling" data-content="Learned the different types of bias when it comes to sampling a population. Along with that, we learned about different types of sampling techniques as well as how to use them to conduct a proper survey. How to analyze surveys using introductory statistical methods such as hypothesis testing and graph evaluation were also taught. The end of semester project had the class work in groups to design a proper survey with a university-life focus. Statistical analysis for the class was done with both R and SAS.">Survey and Sampling</button></li>
								<li><button class="large red button" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover  focus" data-placement="top" title="ST 421/422 Introduction to Mathematical Statistics I/II" data-content="Two semester long course which taught the mathmatical theory behind probability. We were taught about many probability distrubutions; their properties and when to use them. The theory and practical uses behind random variables and other basic statistical properties. At the end of the second course, a group project was given that had the class try and modify a probability distribution to fit a set of data given. R was used in the course.">Mathmatical Statistics</button></li>
								<li><button class="large red button" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover  focus" data-placement="top" title="ST 431 - Introduction to Experimental Design" data-content="Learned how to design proper scientific experiments. This included lessons on how to split treatments up randomly and fairly and how many replications are needed to get a meaningful result. We were taught how to analyze these results and how to draw reasonable conclusions based on the data. The end of semester project included an analysis and critique of an experiment used in a scientific research paper. SAS was used heavily in this course to assign treatments randomly and to analyze the data.">Experimental Design</button></li>

								<li><button class="large red button" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover  focus" data-placement="top" title="ST 442 - Introduction to Data Science" data-content="Learned various data wrangling methods and how to clean data to make it easier to model. Many classification and prediction methods were taught along with the properties behind them and which circumstance is best for each method. There was a large focus on classification such as logistic regression, Knn and SVM. Clustering and neural networks were touched on a bit towards the end of the course. The end of semester project was a solo project that required us to choose a dataset and a specific question we had to answer using many of the techniques learned. A lengthy report was required to communicate the results. This course used R for all data cleaning and machine learning.">Data Science</button></li>
								<li><button class="large red button" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover  focus" data-placement="top" title="CSC 316 -  Data Structures and Algorithms" data-content="Learned the theory and design choices behind many data structures and algorithms in Java. The structures covered includes lists, maps, trees and graphs while the algorithms were mostly sorting algorithms. Written and coding labs were done individually to test the knowledge of how the structures worked and then implemented them in Eclipse. The structures covered includes lists, maps, trees and graphs while the algorithms were mostly sorting algorithms. Projects allowed for us to work in pairs to devise algorithms and basic program structure based on specifications given. The coding portion of the two projects were done individually based on a rough structure given.">Data Structures</button></li>
								<li><button class="large red button" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover  focus" data-placement="top" title="ST 307/445 R and SAS" data-content="These classes were meant to give a basic understanding of the functions, data types and procedures of these languages. Most of the other classes showed us how to use these languages in the specific way for that topic. These were just meant to give us that Introduction. The SAS course was a little more in-depth than the R one. It taught almost everything for the base SAS certification. While taking the certification wasn't required, it was encouraged to sometime after the course.">Statistical Programming</button></li>
